<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p><span class='smcap'>General Denikin</span> is now in London. This is
the first visit he has paid to this country since his last assassination
by the Bolshevists.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>New proposals regarding telephone charges are expected as soon as the
Select Committee has reported. If the system of charging by time in
place of piece-work is adopted it will mean ruination to many
business-men.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>The Swiss Government has issued orders that ex-monarchs may enter the
country without passports. It is required, however, that they should
take their places in the queue.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>It is reported that a Londonderry man walked up to a Sinn Feiner the
other day and said, "Shoot me." We understand that the real reason why
the fellow was not accommodated was that he omitted to say "Please." The
best Sinn Feiners are very punctilious.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"The drinking of intoxicants," says an American prohibitionist,
"causes early death in ninety-five cases out of a hundred." Several
Americans, we are informed, have gallantly offered themselves for
experimental purposes.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"It is a scandal," says a contemporary, "that the clerks at Llanelly
should ask for twelve pounds fifteen shillings a week." But surely there
is no harm in asking.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>According to a weekly paper not only is <span class='smcap'>Constance
Binney</span> a famous screen star, but she is also a first-class
ukelele player. The latest reports are that the news has been received
quietly.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"If slightly cut before cooking, potatoes slip out of their skins
easily," says a home journal. This is better than frightening them out
of their skins by jumping out from behind a door and saying "Boo."</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>William Aird</span>, the germ-proof man, has
been giving demonstrations in London. It is reported that last week a
germ snapped at him and broke off two of its teeth.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"In New York the other day," says a contemporary, "the sky kept
streaming silver sheen; mistlike lights pulsated in rapid flashes to the
apex and piled-up stars could be seen." The fact that New York can still
see things like this must be a sorry blow to the Prohibitionists.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"Working men have been hit very hard by the tyrannical Budget,"
announces a morning paper. We too are in sympathy with those miners who
are now faced with only one bottle of champagne a day.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"These cotton boom profits," said the President of the Textile
Institute recently, "are abnormal and unhealthy." The Manchester man,
however, who recently came out with innumerable spots resembling
half-crowns as the result of the boom, declares that no inconvenience is
suffered once the dizziness has passed away.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>From Bungay in Suffolk comes the news that a water-wagtail has built
its nest in a milk-can. We resolutely refrain from comment.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>A youth recently arrested in Dublin was found not to have a revolver
on him. He is being detained for a medical examination.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>A great many people are committing suicide, says the Vicar of St.
Mathew's, Portsmouth, because they have nothing to live for. We
disagree. <i>The Weekly Dispatch's</i> accounts of the next world are
well worth staying alive for.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Airships under construction, declares
Air-Commodore <span class='smcap'>E. M. Maitland</span>, will make the
passage to Australia in nine and a-half days. In tax-paying circles it
is said that the fashionable thing will be to start now and let the
airship overtake you if it can.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>More than a million Americans, it is stated, are preparing to visit
Europe this summer. It is thought that there is at least a sporting
chance that some of them will be hoist with their own bacon.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>"The man who does not know Latin," says the Dean
of <span class='smcap'>Durham</span>, "is not really educated." Several
uneducated business men are said to have written to
the <span class='smcap'>Dean</span> asking the Latin for what they think
of the new Budget.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>At a recent wedding in Tyrone young men who had come to wish the
bride and bridegroom luck lit a fire against the door, blocked the
chimney with straw, broke the windows, threw water and cayenne-pepper on
the wedding-party and bombarded the house with stones for two hours. It
is just this joyous, care-free nature of the Irish that the stolid
Englishman will never learn to appreciate.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>We understand that the man who tried to gain admission to the Zoo on
Sunday by making a noise like a Fellow of the Zoological Society was
detected in the act.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>A person who recently attempted to commit suicide by lying down on
the Caledonian Railway line was found to have a razor in one pocket and
a bottle of laudanum in the other. The Company, we understand,
strenuously deny the necessity of these alternatives.</p>

not one of the onlookers made any effort to save the lady.</p>

<h2>A TRYING DAY IN MEDI&AElig;VAL TIMES.</h2>

<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> public torturer hurried home in an
irritable frame of mind. The day had been for him one long round of
annoyances. When he commenced his duties that morning, already
exasperated by the thought that if the drought continued the produce of
his tiny patch of ground would be completely ruined, he was aggrieved to
find that far more than his fair share of a recently arrived batch of
heretics had been allotted to him. During the midday break for
refreshments his dreamy assistant had allowed the furnace to go out,
bringing upon the torturer's own head a severe censure for the
consequent delay. In the afternoon, glancing occasionally through the
narrow window, he was mortified to see that the promising rain-clouds,
which might yet have saved his cabbages, were dispersing; and then, to
crown all, just as he was finishing for the day he had caught hold of a
pair of pincers a trifle too near the white-hot end and seared his
hand.</p>

<p>As he approached the cottage which was enshrined in his heart by a
thousand sacred associations as home, the torturer strove to rise
superior to his worries. He whistled bravely as he crossed the threshold
and caressed his wife with his usual tenderness. Intuitively she divined
the bitterness of the mood which lay beneath the torturer's seeming
cheerfulness, but she stifled her curiosity like the wise little woman
she was and hastened to lay his supper before him. Through the progress
of the meal&mdash;prepared by her in the way the torturer loved so
well&mdash;she diverted him with her lively prattle. And at length, when
she trod on the dog and caused it to give out a long-drawn howl, she
made such a neat allusion to the Chamber and heretics that the torturer
laughed till the tears streamed down his cheeks.</p>

<p>After the table was cleared the torturer's little blue-eyed girl came
toddling up to him for her usual half-hour's cuddle. It made a beautiful
picture&mdash;the little mite with her father's merry eyes and her
mother's rosebud mouth, sitting on the torturer's knee, her golden hair
mingling with his beard. And how her silvery laugh brightened the place
as she played her favourite game of stretching her rag doll on a toy
model of a rack.</p>

<p>The sound of rain outside brought the torturer and his wife to the
door. As they stood side by side watching the downpour the last vestige
of the torturer's ill-humour passed away. This rain would mean a record
year for his cabbages, and would do wonders for his beans, which were
already a long way more forward than those of the executioner.</p>

<p>He realised now that he had allowed the mishaps of the day to worry
him unduly. After all, his hand had suffered little more than a scorch
and no longer pained him, and, although the censure he had received in
the Chamber and the possible consequences had been very disquieting, yet
he was now able to assure himself and his wife that if henceforth he
kept his assistant from wool-gathering all would be well.</p>

<p>Suddenly he fell back trembling from the threshold, his face blanched
with terror. A large rain-drop had splashed on his forehead, reminding
him abruptly that before coming home that evening he had neglected to
fill the water-dripping apparatus, which might be required at dawn for
the more obstinate of the heretics.</p>

<hr class='half' />

<h2>TALL TALK.</h2>

<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> fact that the Bishop-Elect
of <span class='smcap'>Pretoria</span>, the Rev.
<span class='smcap'>Neville Talbot</span>, is no less than six feet six inches high,
surpassing his predecessor by two inches, has been freely
commented on in the Press. Anxious to ascertain from
leaders of public opinion the true significance of the appointment,
Mr. Punch has been at pains to collect their views.
How divergent and even contradictory they are may be
gathered from the following selection:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <span class='smcap'>Martin Conway</span>, the Apostle of
Altitude, as he has been recently denominated, welcomed the appointment
of Bishop <span class='smcap'>Talbot</span> as a good omen for the
campaign which he is so ably conducting. "Nothing," he remarks, "has
impressed me so much in the works of <span class='smcap'>Tennyson</span>
as the line, 'We needs must love the highest when we see it.' Mountain
or building or man, it is all the same. I never felt so happy in all my
travels in South America as when I was in Patagonia, the home of tall
men and the giant sloth. At all costs we should recognise and cultivate
the human skyscraper."</p>

<p>The Bishop of <span class='smcap'>Hereford</span>
(Dr. <span class='smcap'>Hensley Henson</span>) expressed the hope that
the appointment of bishops would not be governed solely by an
anthropometric standard. It would be a misfortune if the impression were
created that preferment to the episcopal bench was confined to High
Churchmen.</p>

<p>The Editor of <i>The Times</i> declined to dogmatize on the subject.
He pointed out however that the average height of the Yugo-Slavs
exceeded that of the Welsh. The claims of small nations could not, of
course, be overlooked, but he considered it as little short of a
calamity when a Great Power had an undersized Prime Minister. Short men
liked short cuts, but, as <span class='smcap'>Bacon</span> said, the
shortest way is commonly the foulest.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class='smcap'>Robert Bridges</span> (the Poet-Laureate)
writes to say that, having given special study to the hexameter, he was
much interested to find that the measure now in vogue amongst bishops
was that of six feet and over. He hoped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
to treat the subject exhaustively in his forthcoming treatise
on Ecclesiastical Prosody.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class='smcap'>L. C. Amery</span>, M.P., strongly
deprecated the attempt to identify excessive height with extreme
efficiency. In the election to Fellowships at All Souls no height limit
was imposed. <span class='smcap'>Napoleon</span> and the late
Lord <span class='smcap'>Roberts</span> were both small men, and he
believed that the remarkable elusiveness displayed by
Colonel <span class='smcap'>Lawrence</span> in the War was greatly
facilitated by his diminutive stature. The testimony of literature
throughout the ages was almost unanimous in its condemnation of giants.
He had never heard of a small ogre. On the subject
of <span class='smcap'>Shakespeare's</span> height he could not speak
with assurance, but <span class='smcap'>Keats</span> was only just over
five feet. Jumbomania, or the worship of mammoth dimensions, was a
modern disease. Far better was the philosophy crystallised in such
immortal sayings as "Love me little, love me long," and "Infinite riches
in a little room."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Mallaby-Deeley</span>, M.P., observed that,
man being an imitative animal and bishops being regarded by many as good
examples, there seemed to him a serious danger of an epidemic of what he
might call Brobdingnagitis. Fortunately the results would not be
immediately apparent, otherwise he would be compelled to raise his
tariff for cheap suits. A rise of six inches in the average height of
his customers would throw out all his calculations and eat up the modest
margin of profit which he now allowed himself.</p>

<h2>MASCULINE MODES.</h2>

<p class='center subtitle'><span class='smcap'>By Beau Brummel</span>.</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> news that the price of lounge suits
will have risen to twenty-four pounds by the autumn has created
something of a sartorial panic in the City and the West End.</p>

<p>Famous old wardrobes are being broken up on all sides by owners
anxious to acquire fresh clothing before it is too late, whilst the
small properties thus created find eager tenants amongst those who
cannot afford a new outfit at all.</p>

<p>Many tailors who have built new suits are beginning to dispose of
them on three or five year repairing leases, and possession of these may
sometimes be secured from the present occupiers on payment of a
substantial premium.</p>

<p>Gentlemen possessing both town and country sets of suitings are in
many cases letting the latter in order to come up to London for the
season, whilst others are resorting to various economical artifices to
meet the crisis. Plus four golf knickers, let down, make admirable
wedding trousers for a short man, and many are the old college blazers
dyed black and doing duty as natty pea-jackets.</p>

<p>In the City, of course, fustian and corduroys are almost the only
wear, and there is much divergence of opinion on the Stock Exchange as
to the best knot for spotted red neckerchiefs and the proper way of
tying the difficult little bow beneath the knees.</p>

<p>In Parliament, where of course the old costly fashions have long been
out of vogue, the change is equally noticeable.
Lord <span class='smcap'>Robert Cecil</span>, for instance, habitually
wears the white canvas suit in which Mr. <span class='smcap'>Augustus
John</span> painted him; Lord <span class='smcap'>Birkenhead</span>
mounts the Woolsack in an old cassock, which, as he points out, not only
allows a very scanty attire underneath it, but gives him particular
confidence in elucidating St. Matthew; while
the <span class='smcap'>Prime Minister</span> himself set off for San
Remo in a simple set of striped sackcloth dittos. Many Members are
having their old pre-war morning coats turned; Mr.
<span class='smcap'>Winston Churchill</span> in machine-gun overalls,
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Mallaby-Deeley</span> self-dressed,
Sir <span class='smcap'>Edward Carson</span> in a simple union suit, are
conspicuous figures, and Mr. <span class='smcap'>Horatio
Bottomley</span> by a whimsical yet thrifty fancy often attends the
House in the humble attire of the Weaver in <i>A Midsummer Night's
Dream</i>.</p>

<p>Even in the Welsh collieries it is becoming the habit to go down the
pits in rough home-spun, and reserving the top hat, morning coat and
check trousers for striking in.</p>

<h3>A VANISHED SPECIES.</h3>

<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> great auk is but a memory; the bittern
booms more rarely in our eastern marshes; and now they tell me
Brigadiers are extinct. Handsomest and liveliest of our indigenous
fauna, the bright beady eye, the flirt of the trench coat-tail through
the undergrowth, the glint of red betwixt the boughs, the sudden
piercing pipe&mdash;how well I knew them, how often I have lain hidden
in thickets and behind hedgerows to study them more closely. How
inquisitive the creature was, yet how seldom would it feed from the
hand. And now, it seems, they are gone.</p>

<p>Vainly I rack my brains to envisage the manner of their passing. Is
there to be nothing left but silence and a shadow or a specimen in a
dusty case of glass preserved in creosol and stuffed with lime? Or did
not the Brigadiers rather, when they felt their last hour was upon them,
retire like the elephants of the jungle to some distant spot and shuffle
off the mortal coil in the midst of Salisbury Plain or (for so I still
picture it despite the ravages of a rude commercialism) the vast
solitude of Slough?</p>

<p>Or it may be that they underwent some classic metamorphosis,
translated to a rainless paradise, where they dreamed of battalions for
ever inspected and the general salute eternally blown.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"And there, they say, two bright and ag&eacute;d snakes<br /> Who once
were brigadiers of infantry<br /> Bask in the sun."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyhow, I cannot believe that ex-Brigadiers die. They only fade away.
Fade away, I think, like the Cheshire Cat in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
leaving at the last not a grin but a scowl behind them. "<i>Brigadiers
will fade away</i>," I imagine, ran the instruction from the Army
Council, "<i>passing the vanishing point in the following
order:&mdash;</i></p>

<ul>
<li>(1) <i>Spurs.</i></li>
<li>(2) <i>Field Boots.</i></li>
<li>(3) <i>Main body.</i></li>
<li>(4) <i>Brass hat.</i></li>
<li>(5) <i>Scowl.</i>"</li>
</ul>

<p>But oh, how they will be missed, with their insatiable hunger for
replies! I remember one in particular, very fierce and black-moustached,
who used to pop up suddenly from behind a Loamshire hedge with an
enormous note-book in his hand and say to unhappy company commanders,
"The situation is so-and-so and so-and-so; now let me hear you give your
orders." And the Company-Commander, who would have liked to read
through <i>Infantry Training</i> once or twice and then hold a sort of
inter-allied conference with his Platoon-Commander, putting the Company
Sergeant-Major in the chair, felt that after frightfulness of this kind
mere actual war would probably be child's-play. And yet they tell me he
was a pleasant enough fellow in the Mess, this Brigadier, and liked good
cooking. Now I come to think of it, he faded away before the War came to
an end. He faded away into a Major-General.</p>

<p>How different from this sort was the type that could always be
placated by a glittering bayonet charge or a thoroughly smart salute! I
remember one of this kind who came charging across the landscape, his
Staff Captain at his heels, to a point where he saw a friend of mine
apparently lost in meditation and sloth. Unfortunately the great man's
horse betrayed him as he tried to jump a low hedge, and, when he had
clambered up again and arrived in a rather tumbled condition to ask
indignantly what had happened to the scouts, "They have established a
number of hidden observation posts," my friend replied, keeping his
presence of mind, "and are making an exact report of everything that
transpires on the enemy's front," and he waved his arm towards the scene
of the catastrophe. It was not thought necessary to examine their
notes.</p>

<p>In France Brigadiers were mainly divided into the sort that came
round the front line themselves, and the sort that sent the
Brigade-major or somebody else who had broken out into a frontal
inflammation to do it for them. It is difficult to say
which <i>genus</i> was the more alarming.</p>

<p>The first was apt to exhibit its contempt for danger by strolling
about in perilous places for five minutes and leaving them to be shelled
in consequence for a week.</p>

<p>The second sort was apt to issue orders depending for fulfilment on a
faulty map reference or a landmark which had been carelessly removed by
an H.E. shell. One of the most <i>intransigeant</i> of this kind whom I
remember could always, however, be softened by souvenirs; a cast-off
Uhlan's lance or the rifle of a Bosch sniper went far to console him for
the barrenness of a patrol report. I feel sure he must have faded at
Slough.</p>

<p>But it was in battle that their wild appetite for information was
most amazingly displayed. At moments when nobody knew where anybody else
was or whether the ground underneath him was likely to remain in that
sector more than a few moments or be detached and transferred to
another, they would send by telephone or by a runner wild messages for
an exact <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the situation. It was at such
times, I think, that some of those eminent war correspondents recently
knighted would have done yeoman service in the front line. I can imagine
them telephoning somewhat after this manner, in answer to the querulous
voice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"All hell has broken loose in front of us. The earth
shivers as if a volcano is beneath our feet. The pock-marked ridges in
the distance are covered with the advancing waves of field-grey forms.
Our boys are going up happily shouting and singing to the battle. Sorry,
I didn't quite catch what you said about being in touch on the right.
The brazen roar of the cannon is mingled with the intermittent rattle of
innumerable machine guns. Eh, what? What?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, I think the Brigadiers would have liked that. But, alas, it
could not be. And now they have gone, with their passion for questions,
never to return, or never till the next A.C.I. cancels the last.</p>

<h2>THE TAKING OF TIMOTHY.</h2>

<p><span class='smcap'>Tea</span> was over, a clearing was made of the
articles of more fragile virtue, and Timothy, entering in state, was
off-loaded from his nurse's arms into his mother's.</p>

<p>"Isn't he looking sweet to-day?" said Suzanne. "It's really time we
had him photographed."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, why do people as a rule get photographed?"</p>

<p>"That," I said, "is a question I have often asked myself, but without
finding a satisfactory answer. What do you propose to do with the
copies?"</p>

<p>"There are dozens of people who'll be only too glad to have them.
Aunt Caroline, for instance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aunt Caroline one day took me into her confidence and showed me what
she called her scrap-heap. It was a big box full of photographs that had
been presented to her from time to time, and she calculated that if she
had had them all framed, as their donors had doubtless expected, it
would have cost her some hundreds of pounds. While her back was turned I
looked through the collection. Your photograph was there&mdash;and mine,
Suzanne."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we shall want one to keep ourselves. Think what a pleasure
it will be to him when he grows up to see what he looked like as a tiny
baby."</p>

<p>I called to mind an ancestral album belonging to my own family that I
had carefully kept guarded from Suzanne precisely for the reason that it
contained various presentments of myself at early ages in
mirth-compelling garments and attitudes; but of course I could not now
urge that chamber of horrors in opposition to her demand.</p>

<p>"Besides," she went on, "we needn't buy any copies at all if we don't
like them. Snapper and Klick are continually worrying me to have Baby
taken. Once a week regularly, ever since the announcement of his birth
appeared, they've rung me up to ask when he will give them a sitting.
Sometimes it's Snapper and sometimes it's Klick; I don't know which is
which, but one of them has adenoids. We can't do any harm by taking him
there, because they say in their circulars they present two copies free
and there's no obligation to purchase any."</p>

<p>"I wonder how they make that pay?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Suzanne, "they keep the copyright, you know, and then when
he does anything famous they send it round to the illustrated papers,
which pay them no end of money for permission to reproduce it."</p>

<p>"But by the time <i>he</i> does anything famous," I objected, "won't
this photograph be a trifle out of date? Supposing, for instance, in
twenty or thirty years' time he marries a Movie Queen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the telephone-bell rang, and Suzanne, as is her wont,
rushed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg
328]</a></span> answer it, dropping Timothy into my arms on the way.</p>

<p>"Hello!" I heard her say. "Yes; speaking. Yes, I was just going to
write. Yes; that will do quite well. What? Yes, about eleven.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Not another appointment with the dressmaker?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No. Curiously enough it was Klick again&mdash;or Snapper&mdash;and
his adenoids are worse than ever; I suppose it's the damp weather gets
into them. So I said we'd take Baby to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see the connection," I said. "Besides, aren't they
catching?"</p>

<p>"Now you're being funny again. Save that up for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked in some alarm. "And why did you say
<i>we'd</i> take Baby?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course you've got to come too. You can always make him laugh
better than anyone else; it's your
<i>m&eacute;tier</i>. And I do want his delicious
little dimples to come out."</p>

<p>"Do I understand that I'm to go through my <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i>
in cold blood and under the unsympathetic gaze of Messrs. Snapper and
Klick? Suzanne, it can't be done."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! You've only got to sing <i>Pop Goes the Weasel</i> in
a falsetto voice and make one of those comic faces you do so well, and
he'll gurgle at once. Well, that's settled. We start at half-past ten
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The coming ordeal so preyed upon my mind that I spent a most restless
night, during which, so Suzanne afterwards told me, I announced at
frequent intervals the popping of the weasel. The day dawned with a
steady drizzle of rain, and, after a poor attempt at breakfast, I
scoured the neighbourhood for a taxi. Having at last run one to earth, I
packed the expedition into it&mdash;Suzanne, Timothy, Timothy's nurse
and Barbara (who begged so hard to be allowed to "come and see Father
make faces at Baby" that Suzanne weakly consented).</p>

<p>Arrived at our destination, Suzanne bade the driver wait. "We shall
never find another cab to take us home in this downpour," she said, "and
we shan't be kept long."</p>

<p>We were ushered into the studio by a gentleman I now know to have
been Mr. Klick. He aroused my distrust at once by the fact that he did
not wear a velvet coat, and I pointed out this artistic deficiency in a
whisper to Suzanne.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she whispered back; "we needn't buy any if they're not
good."</p>

<p>Timothy, who had by now been put straight by his attendant, was
carefully placed on all-fours on a pile of cushions, which he promptly
proceeded to chew. Mr. Klick, on attempting to correct the pose, was
received with a hymn of hate that compelled him to bury his head hastily
in the camera-cloth, and Suzanne arranged the subject so that some of
his more recognisable features became visible.</p>

<p>"Now then," she said to me, "make him smile."</p>

<p>With a furtive glance at Mr. Klick, who fortunately was still playing
the ostrich, I essayed a well-tried "face" that had almost invariably
evoked a chuckle from Timothy, even when visitors were present. On this
occasion, however, it failed to produce anything more than a woebegone
pucker that foreshadowed something worse. Hastily I switched off into
another expression, but with no better result.</p>

<p>"Go on, Father," encouraged
Bar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg
329]</a></span>bara, who had been taking a breathless interest in these
proceedings; "try your funny voice."</p>

<p>Mr. Klick had emerged from cover and was standing expectantly with
his hand on the cap.</p>

<p>Dear reader, have you ever been called upon to sing <i>Pop Goes the
Weasel</i> in a falsetto voice before a fractious baby, a small but
intensely critical child, a stolidly contemptuous nurse, an agitated
mother and a gaping photographer, with the knowledge that success or
failure hangs upon your lips, and that all the time a diabolical machine
in the street below is scoring threepence against you every minute or
so? Of course you haven't; but possibly you may be able to enter into my
feelings in this hour of trial. With a prickly heat suffusing my whole
body and a melting sensation at the collar I struggled through the
wretched lyric once. Timothy regarded me first with scorn and then with
positive distaste. In desperation I squeaked it out again and yet again,
but each succeeding "pop" only registered another scowl on the face of
my offspring and another threepence on that of the cabman's clock.</p>

<p>I was maddened now, and Suzanne sought to restrain me; but I shook
her off violently and went on again <i>da capo</i>, and was just giving
vent for about the seventeenth time to a particularly excruciating "pop"
when the door of the studio opened and a benevolent-looking old
gentleman entered. He gazed at us all in wonderment, and, overcome by
mingled shame and exhaustion, I sank into a chair and popped no
more.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Snapper," said Mr. Klick, "we were just trying to get this
young gentleman amused."</p>

<p>Mr. Snapper, who, I should imagine, was the adenoid victim, looked
first at me and next at Timothy, and then blew his nose vigorously. It
was not an ordinary blast, but had a peculiarly musical <i>timbre</i>,
very much like the note of a mouth-organ. It certainly attracted
Timothy's attention, for he at once looked round and the glimmer of a
smile appeared upon his tear-stained face.</p>

<p>"That's it!" cried Barbara excitedly. "Do it again."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> do," entreated Suzanne.</p>

<p>Mr. Snapper, adenoids or no adenoids, was a sportsman. He quickly
understood what was required of him and blew his nose again and again.
And with each blow Timothy's smile became wider, the dimples grew
deeper, and Mr. Klick at the camera was pushing in and pulling out
plates for all he was worth. At last Mr. Snapper could blow no more, and
with profuse thanks we gathered ourselves, together and departed. On our
arrival home the cabman, fortunately, was induced to accept a cheque in
payment.</p>

<p>The photographs have turned out a great success. One in particular,
which shows the first smile breaking through Timothy's tears, is of a
very happy character, and Mr. Snapper has asked and received permission
to send it to the illustrated Press under the title, "Sunshine and
Shower"; and Aunt Caroline has not only been given a copy, <i>but has
had it framed</i>.</p>

<p>Now, when I am called upon to produce a laugh from Timothy, I no
longer make faces or "pop." I have discovered how to blow my nose like a
mouth-organ. It's trying work, but the effect is magical.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p><i>Monday, April 19th.</i>&mdash;Primrose day in the House of Commons
was more honoured in the breach than the observance. Barely a dozen
Members sported Lord <span class='smcap'>Beaconfield's</span> favourite
flower (for salads), and one of them found himself so uncomfortably
conspicuous that shortly after the proceedings opened he furtively
transferred his buttonhole to his coat-pocket. Among those who remained
faithful were Lord <span class='smcap'>Lambourne</span> (in the Peers'
Gallery), who had for this occasion substituted a posy of primroses for
his usual picotee, and, quaintly enough,
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Hogge</span>, who had not hitherto been
suspected of Disraelian sympathies.</p>

</div>

<p>"Mr. <span class='smcap'>Hogge</span> had not hitherto
been suspected of Disraelian sympathies."</p>
</div>

<p>For a Budget-day the attendance was smaller than usual. But it was
large enough to prevent Mr. <span class='smcap'>Billing</span> from
securing his usual seat. The <span class='smcap'>Speaker</span>,
however, did not smile upon his suggestion that he should occupy one of
the vacant places on the Front Opposition Bench, and curtly informed him
that there was plenty of room in the Gallery. Thither
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Billing</span> betook himself, and thence he
addressed a question which Mr. <span class='smcap'>Hope</span>, the
Minister concerned, was unable to catch, his ears not being attuned to
sounds from that altitude.</p>

<p>Otherwise Question-time was chiefly remarkable for the loud and
continued burst of cheering from the Coalition benches which greeted
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Will Thorne's</span> suggestion (<i>&agrave;
propos</i> of <span class='smcap'>Lenin's</span> industrial
conscription) that "it would be a very good thing to make all the idlers
in this country work." Mr. <span class='smcap'>Thorne</span> seemed
quite embarrassed by the popularity of his proposal, which did not,
however, appear to arouse the same enthusiasm among his colleagues of
the Labour Party.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock when Mr. <span class='smcap'>Chamberlain</span>
rose to "open the Budget" (he clings to that old-fashioned phrase), and
just after six when he completed a speech which
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Asquith</span> (himself an ex-Chancellor of the
Exchequer) justly praised for its lucidity and comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Chamberlain</span> could not on this occasion
congratulate himself (as his predecessors were wont to do) on the
accuracy of his forecasts. He had two shots last year, in Spring and
Autumn, but both times was many millions out in his calculations.
Fortunately all the mistakes were on the right side, and he came out
with a surplus of one hundred and sixty-four millions (about as much as
the whole revenue of the country when first he went to the Exchequer) to
devote to the redemption of debt.</p>

<p>But that did not content him. For an hour by the clock he piled up
the burdens on the taxpayer. His arguments were not always consistent.
It is not quite easy to see why, because ladies have taken to smoking
cigarettes, an extra heavy duty should be imposed on imported cigars; or
how the appearance of "a new class of champagne-drinkers" justifies a
further tax upon the humble consumer of "dinner-claret."</p>

<p>Nor is it easy to follow the process of reasoning by which
the <span class='smcap'>Chancellor</span> convinced himself that the
Excess Profits Tax, which last year he described as a great deterrent to
enterprise and industry, only, justifiable as "a temporary measure,"
should now be not merely continued but increased by fifty per cent.</p>

<img src='images/i-333bth.png' alt='' title='Click for

</a>

<p><i>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Chamberlain</span>.</i>
"<span class='smcap'>I don't care what anybody says about this blooming
tree (I use the epithet in its literal sense); I shall let it keep on
for another year</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>This proposal seemed to excite more hostility than any other. But the
single taxers were annoyed by the final disappearance of the Land Values
Duties (the only original feature of Mr. <span class='smcap'>Lloyd
George's</span> epoch-making first Budget).
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Raffan</span> pictured their author being
dragged at the Tory chariot-wheels, and
Dr. <span class='smcap'>Murray</span> observed that the land-taxes were
evidently not allowed "on the other side of the Rubicon."</p>

<p>The general view was that the Government had shown courage in
imposing fresh taxation, but would have saved themselves and the country
a great deal of trouble if they had been equally bold in reducing
expenditure.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, April 20th.</i>&mdash;When a local band at Cologne
recently played the "Wacht am Rhein" the British officers present stood
up, on the ground (as they explained to a surprised German)
that <i>they</i> were now the Watch on the Rhine. But are they?
According to Colonel <span class='smcap'>Burn</span> the Army of the
Rhine is now so short of men that it is compelled to employ German
civilians as batmen, clerks and even telephone-operators; and
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Churchill</span> was fain to admit that it would
not surprise him to hear that "some assistance has been derived from the
local population."</p>

<p>The Carnarvonshire police are peeved because they are not allowed to
belong to any secret society except the Freemasons, and consequently are
debarred from membership of the Royal Ante-diluvian Order of Buffaloes.
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Shortt</span> disclaimed responsibility, but it
is expected that the Member for the Carnarvon Boroughs, who is
notoriously sympathetic to Ante-diluvians (is not his
motto <i>Apr&egrave;s moi le d&eacute;luge</i>?), will take up the
matter on his return from San Remo.</p>

<p>Having had time to consider the Budget proposals in detail
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Asquith</span> was less complimentary and more
critical. Good-humoured chaff of the <span class='smcap'>Prime
Minister</span> on the demise of the Land Values Duties before they had
yielded the "rare and refreshing fruits" promised ten years ago, was
followed by a reasoned condemnation of the proposed increase in the wine
duties, which he believed would diminish consumption and cause
international complications with our Allies.
The <span class='smcap'>Chancellor</span>, again, had thought too much
of revenue and too little of economy. He urged him&mdash;in a
magnificent mixture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334"
id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> metaphors&mdash;to cut away those
parasitic excrescences upon the normal administrative system of the
country which now constituted an open tap.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, April 21st.</i>&mdash;The abolition of the
Guide-lecturer at Kew Gardens was deplored by
Lord <span class='smcap'>Sudeley</span> and other Peers. But as,
according to Lord <span class='smcap'>Lee</span>, out of a million
visitors last year only five hundred listened to the Guide&mdash;an
average of less than three per lecture&mdash;the Government can hardly
be blamed for saving a hundred pounds. Retrenchment, after all, must
begin somewhere.</p>

<p>Sir <span class='smcap'>Donald Maclean</span> cannot have heard of
this signal example of Government economy or he would not have denounced
Ministers so vehemently for their extravagance. His most specific charge
was that in Mesopotamia they were "spending money like water in looking
for oil."</p>

<p>In a further defence of the Budget proposals
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Chamberlain</span> disclaimed the notion that it
was the duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to denounce in the House
the Estimates which he had approved in Cabinet. His business was to find
the money. Circumstances had altered his attitude to the Excess Profits
Duty, and he was now determined to stick to it. Did not a cynic once say
that nothing succeeds like excess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Barnes</span>, who was loudly cheered on his
return to the House, joined in the cry for economy. "Some departments,"
he declared, "existed only because they had existed."</p>

<p>The country clergy are without doubt the most over-rated persons in
the country&mdash;I mean, of course, from a fiscal point of view.
Consequently the House gave a friendly reception to a Bill intended to
relieve them of some of their pecuniary burdens.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class='smcap'>Asquith</span> on the Land Values
Duties.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Thursday, April 22nd.</i>&mdash;When Dr.
<span class='smcap'>Macnamara</span> was Secretary to the Admiralty no
Minister was clearer or more direct in his answers. Now that he has
become Minister he has laid aside his quarter-deck manner and adopted
tones of whispering humbleness which hardly reach the Press Gallery.</p>


<p>He ought to take example fro Mr.
<span class='smcap'>Stanton</span>, who never leaves the House in doubt
as to what he means. This afternoon, his purpose was to announce that a
certain "Trio" on the Opposition Benches was in league with the forces
of disorder. "Bolshies!" he shouted in a voice that frightened the
pigeons in Palace Yard.</p>

<p>Later in the evening Mr. <span class='smcap'>Stanton</span> indicated
that unless the salaries of Members of Parliament were raised he should
have seriously to consider the question of returning to his old trade of
a coal-hewer, at which I gathered he could make much more money with an
infinitely smaller exertion of lung-power.</p>

<p>The vote for Agriculture and Fisheries was supported by Sir
A. <span class='smcap'>Griffith-Boscawen</span> in a speech crammed full
of miscellaneous information. We learned that the Minister once smoked a
pipe of Irish tobacco, and said "Never Again"; that the slipper-limpet,
formerly the terror of the oyster-beds had now by the ingenuity of his
Department been transformed into a valuable source of poultry-food, and
that the roundabout process by which the Germans in bygone days imported
eel-fry from the Severn for their own rivers, and then exported the
full-grown fish for the delectation of East-end dinner-tables, had been
done away with. In the matter of eels this country is now
self-supporting.</p>

<h2>LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.</h2>

<p class='smcap subtitle'>"The Bear-Garden."</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> authors of the guide-books have
signally failed to discover the really interesting parts of Law-land. I
have looked through several of these works and not one of them refers,
for example, to the "Bear-Garden," which is the place where the
preliminary skirmishes of litigation are carried out. The Bear-Garden is
the name given to it by the legal profession, so I am quite in order in
using the title. In fact, if you want to get to it, you <i>have</i> to
use that title. The proper title would be something like "the place
where Masters in Chambers function at half-past one;" but, if you go
into the Law Courts and ask one of the attendants where that is, he will
say, rather pityingly, "Do you mean the <i>Bear-Garden</i>?" and you
will know at once that you have lost caste. Caste is a thing you should
be very careful of in these days, so the best thing is to ask for the
Bear-Garden straightaway.</p>

<p>It is in the purlieus of the Law Courts and very hard to find. It is
up a lot of very dingy back-staircases and down a lot of very dingy
passages. The Law Courts are like all our public buildings. The parts
where the public is allowed to go are fairly respectable, if not
beautiful, but the purlieus and the basements and the upper floors are
scenes of unimaginable dinginess and decay. The Law Courts' purlieus are
worse than the Houses of Parliament's purlieus, and it seems to me that
even more disgraceful things are done in them. It only shows you the
danger of Nationalisation.</p>

<p>On the way to the Bear-Garden you pass the King's Remembrancer's This
is the man who reminds <span class='smcap'>His Majesty</span> about
people's birthdays; and in a large family like that he must be kept
busy. Not far from the King's Remembrancer there is a Commissioner for
Oaths; you can go into his room and have a really good swear for about
half-a-crown. This is cheaper than having it in the street&mdash;that
is, if you are a gentleman; for by the Profane Oaths Act, 1745, swearing
and cursing are punishable by a fine of one shilling for every
day-labourer, soldier or seaman; two shillings for every other person
under the degree of a gentleman; and five shillings for every person of
or above the degree of a gentleman. This is not generally known. The
Commissioner of Oaths is a very broad-minded man, and there is literally
no limit to what you may swear before him.
The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg
335]</a></span> only thing is that he insists on your filing it before
you actually say it. This may cause delay; so that if you are feeling
particularly strongly about anything it is probably better to have it
out in the street and risk being taken for a gentleman.</p>

<p>There are a number of other interesting functionaries on the way to
the Bear-Garden; but we must get on. When you have wandered about in the
purlieus for a long time you will hear a tremendous noise, a sort of
combined snarling and roaring and legal conversation. When you hear
that, you will know that you are very near the bears. They are all
snarling and roaring in a large preliminary arena, where the bears
prepare themselves for the struggle; all round it are smaller cages or
aren&aelig;, where the struggles take place. If possible you ought to go
early, so that you can watch the animals massing. Lawyers, as I have had
occasion to observe before, are the most long-suffering profession in
the country, and the things they do in the Bear-Garden they have to do
in the luncheon-hour, or rather in the luncheon half-hour, between
half-past one and two.</p>

<p>This accounts perhaps for the extreme frenzy of the proceedings. They
hurry in a frenzy up the back-stairs about 1.25, and they pace up and
down in a frenzy till half-past one. There are all sorts of bears, most
of them rather seedy old bears, with shaggy and unkempt coats. These are
solicitors' clerks, and they all come straight out
of <span class='smcap'>Dickens</span>. They have shiny little
private-school handbags, each inherited, no doubt, through a long line
of ancestral solicitors' clerks; and they all have the draggled sort of
moustache that tells you when it is going to rain. While they are pacing
up and down the arena they all try to get rid of these moustaches by
pulling violently at alternate ends; but the only result is to make it
look more like rain than ever.</p>

<p>Some of the bears are robust old bears, with well-kept coats and loud
roars; these are solicitors' clerks too, only better fed; or else they
are real solicitors. And a few of the bears are perky young
creatures&mdash;in barrister's robes, either for the first time, when
they look very self-conscious, or for the second time, when they look
very self-confident. All the bears are telling each other about their
cases. They are saying, "We are a deceased wife's sister suing <i>in
forma pauperis</i>," or "I am a discharged bankrupt, three times
convicted of perjury, but I am claiming damages under the Diseases of
Pigs Act, 1862," or "You are the crew of a merchant-ship and we are the
editor of a newspaper." Just at first it is rather disturbing to hear
snatches of conversation like that, but there is no real cause for
alarm; they are only identifying themselves with the interests of their
clients; and, when one realises that, one is rather touched.</p>

<p>At long last one of the keepers at the entrance to the small cages
begins to shout very loudly. It is not at all clear what he is shouting,
but apparently it is the pet-names of the bears, for there is a wild
rush for the various cages. Across the middle of the cage a stout
barricade has been erected, and behind the barricade sits the Master,
pale but defiant. Masters in Chambers are barristers who have not got
proper legal faces, and have had to give up being ordinary barristers on
that account; in the obscurity and
excitement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg
336]</a></span> of the Bear-Garden nobody notices that their faces are
all wrong. The two chief bears rush at the Master and the other bears
jostle round them, egging them on. When they see that they cannot get at
the Master they begin snarling. One of them snarls quietly out of a long
document about the Statement of Claim. He throws a copy of this at the
Master, and the Master tries to get the hang of it while the bear is
snarling; but the other bear is by now beside himself with rage, and he
begins putting in what are called interlocutory snarls, so that the
Master gets terribly confused, though he doesn't let on.</p>

<p>By-and-by all pretence of formality and order is put aside and the
battle really begins. At this stage of the proceedings the rule is that
no fewer than two of the protagonists must be roaring at the same time,
of which one must be the Master. But the more general practice is for
all three of them to roar at the same time. Sometimes, it is true, by
sheer roar-power the Master succeeds in silencing one of the bears for a
moment, but he can never be said to succeed in cowing a bear. If anybody
is cowed it is the Master. Meanwhile the lesser bears press closer and
closer, pulling at the damp ends of their rainy moustaches and making
whispered suggestions for new devilries in the ears of the chief bears,
who nod their heads emphatically but don't pay any attention.</p>

<p>The final stage is the stage of physical violence, when the chief
bears lean over the barricade and shake their paws at the Master; they
think they are only making legal gestures, but the Master knows very
well that they are getting out of hand; he knows then that it is time he
threw them a bun. So he says a soothing word to each of them and runs
his pen savagely through almost everything on their papers. The bears
growl in stupefaction and rage, and take deep breaths to begin again.
But meanwhile the keeper has shouted for a fresh set of bears, who surge
wildly into the room. The old bears are swept aside and creep out,
grunting. What the result of it all is I don't know. Nobody knows. But
the new bears&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>Of</span> course nobody could possibly suspect
Sir <span class='smcap'>James Barrie</span> of plagiarising (save from
himself), yet it will explain something of the atmosphere of <i>Mary
Rose</i> if I say that it is a story with such a theme as that admirable
ghostmonger, the Provost of Eton, would whole-heartedly
approve&mdash;thrilling, sinister, inconclusive&mdash;with (shall I
say?) just a dash of Sir <span class='smcap'>Arthur Conan Doyle</span>
in his other-worldly mood to bring it well into the movement. Naturally
the variations are sheer <span class='smcap'>Barrie</span> and of the
most adroit.</p>

<p>THE BOY WHO WOULD GROW UP FASTER THAN HIS MOTHER.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Mary Rose</i> . . . <span class='smcap'>Miss Fay
Compton</span>.<br />
<i>Harry</i> . . . .   <span class='smcap'>Mr. Robert Loraine</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mary Rose</i> is in fact a girl who couldn't grow up, because
whenever she visited a little mystery island in the Outer Hebrides
"they" who lived in a "lovely, lovely, lovely" vague world beyond these
voices would call her vaguely (to Mr. <span class='smcap'>Norman
O'Neill's</span> charming music), and she would as vaguely return with
no memory of what had passed and no change in her physical condition.
This didn't matter so much when, as a mere child, she disappeared for
thirty days; but when, mother of an incomparable heir of two, she was
rapt away in the middle of a picnic for twenty-five years, and returned
to find a husband, mother and father inexplicably old and changed, and
dreadfully silent about her babe&mdash;well, you see for yourself how
hopeless everything was. As if there were not enough real tragedy in the
world and it were necessary to invent!</p>

<p>I don't think it fair to tell you any more. You shouldn't suffer
these thrills at second-hand. But I can say that, in spite of making it
a point of professional honour to try to keep a warm spine and check the
unbidden tear from trickling down my nose (which makes you look such an
ass before a cynical colleague during the intervals), I was beaten in
both attempts. The "effects" were astonishingly well contrived by both
author and producer (Mr. <span class='smcap'>Holman Clark</span>). You
were not let down at the supreme moment by a hurried shuffle of dimly
seen forms or the click of an electrician's gear suggesting too solid
flesh. The house was in a queer way stunned by the poignancy of the last
scene between the young ghost-mother and the long-sought unrecognised
son, and had to shake itself before it could reward with due applause
the fine playing of as perfect a cast as I have seen for a long time.
There's no manner of doubt that Sir <span class='smcap'>James</span>
"got it over" (as they say) all right.</p>

<p>Miss <span class='smcap'>Fay Compton</span> makes astonishing
strides. Her <i>Mary Rose</i> had adorable shy movements, caresses,
intonations, wistfulnesses. These were traits of <i>Mary Rose</i>, not
tricks of Miss <span class='smcap'>Compton</span>. And they escaped
monotony&mdash;supreme achievement in the difficult circumstances.
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Robert Loraine</span> in the
doubled <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of <i>Mary Rose's</i> husband and son, showed
a very fine skill in his differentiation of the husband's character in
three phases of time and development, and of the son's, with its family
likeness and individual variation. Mr. <span class='smcap'>Ernest
Thesiger</span>, who seems to touch nothing he does not adorn, gave a
fine rendering of as charming a character as ever came out of the
<span class='smcap'>Barrie</span> box&mdash;the superstitious, learned,
courteous crofter's son, student of Aberdeen University, temporary
boatman and (later) minister. He did his best incidentally, by rowing
away without casting off, to corroborate the local legend that the queer
little island sometimes disappeared. Miss <span class='smcap'>Mary
Jerrold</span> was just the perfect <span class='smcap'>Barrie</span>
mother (of <i>Mary Rose</i>). Mr. <span class='smcap'>Arthur
Whitby's</span> parson, Mr. <span class='smcap'>Norman Forbes'</span>
squire, Miss <span class='smcap'>Jean Cadell's</span> housekeeper, left
no chinks in their armour for a critic's spleenful arrow.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>I have</span> a mild grievance against that
talented lady, Miss <span class='smcap'>Marjorie Bowen</span>, for
labelling her latest novel "a romantic fantasy." Because, like all her
other stories, <i>The Cheats</i> (<span class='smcap'>Collins</span>)
moves with such an air of truth, its personages are so human, that I
could delightfully persuade myself that it was all true, and that I had
really shared, with a sometimes quickened pulse, the strange fortunes of
the sombre young hero. But&mdash;fantasy! That is to show the strings
and give away the whole game. However, if you can forget that, the coils
of an admirably woven intrigue will grip your attention and sympathy
throughout. The central figure is one <i>Jaques</i>, who comes to town
as a penniless and love-lorn romantic, to be confronted with the
revelation that he is himself the eldest son, unacknowledged but
legitimate, of His Majesty <span class='smcap'>King Charles the
Second</span>, then holding Court at Whitehall. It is from the plots and
counter-plots, the machinations and subterfuges that follow that
Miss <span class='smcap'>Bowen</span> justifies her title.
Certainly <i>The Cheats</i> establishes her in my mind as our first
writer of historical fiction. The character-drawing is admirable
(especially of poor weak-willed vacillating <i>Jaques</i>, a wonderfully
observed study of the <span class='smcap'>Stuart</span> temperament).
More than ever, also, Miss <span class='smcap'>Bowen</span> might here
be said to write her descriptions with a paint-brush; the whole tale
goes by in a series of glowing pictures, most richly coloured. <i>The
Cheats</i> is not a merry book; its treatment of the foolish heroine in
particular abates nothing of grim justice; but of its art there can be
no two opinions. I wish again that I had been allowed to believe in
it.</p>

<p>It must be unusual in war for a commander-in-chief to be regarded by
his opponents with the respect and admiration that the British forces in
East Africa felt towards
<span class='smcap'>Von Lettow-Vorbeck</span>; from
General <span class='smcap'>Smuts</span>, who congratulated him on his
Order "Pour le M&eacute;rite," down to the British Tommy who promised to
salute him "if ever 'e's copped." The fact that <span class='smcap'>Von
Lettow</span> held out from August, 1914, till after the Armistice with
a small force mainly composed of native askaris, and with hardly any
assistance from overseas, is proof in itself of his organizing ability,
his military leadership and his indomitable determination. As these are
qualities which are valued by his late enemies his story of the
campaign, <i>My Reminiscences of East Africa</i>
(<span class='smcap'>Hurst and Blackett</span>), should appeal to a
large public, especially as it is written on the whole in a sporting
spirit and not without some sense of humour. His descriptions of the
natural difficulties of the country and the methods he adopted for
handling them are interesting and instructive. But in military matters
his story is not altogether convincing; for if his "victories" were as
"decisive" as he represents them how is it that they were followed
almost invariably by retirement? The results are attributed in these
pages to "slight mischances" or "unfavourable conditions" or merely to
"pressure of circumstances." Would it not have been better, while he was
about it, to claim boldly that he was luring us on? This is a question
on which one naturally refers to the maps, and it is therefore all the
more regrettable that these contain no scale of mileage, an omission
which renders them almost meaningless. How many readers, for instance,
will realise that German East Africa was almost twice the size of
Germany? The translation on the whole is
good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg
340]</a></span> though some phrases such as "the at times barely
sufficient ration" are rather too redolent of the Fatherland.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>I see that on the title-page of his latest story Mr. W. E.
<span class='smcap'>Norris</span> is credited with having already
written two others (specified by name), etc. Much virtue in that "etc."
I cannot therefore regard <i>The Triumphs of Sara</i>
(<span class='smcap'>Hutchinson</span>) precisely as the work of a
beginner, though it has a freshness and sense of enjoyment about it that
might well belong to a first book rather than to&mdash;I doubt whether
even Mr. <span class='smcap'>Norris</span> himself could say offhand
what its number is.
<i>Sara</i> and her circle are eminently characteristic of their
creator. You have here the same well-bred well-to-do persons, pleasantly
true to their decorous type, retaining always, despite modernity of
clothes and circumstance, a gentle aroma of late Victorianism.
Perhaps <i>Sara</i> is the most immediate of
Mr.<span class='smcap'>Norris's</span> heroines so far. Her money-bags
had been filled in Manchester, and from time to time in her history you
are reminded of this circumstance. It explains much; though hardly her
marriage with <i>Euan Leppington</i>, whose attraction apparently lay in
being one of the few males of her acquaintance whom <i>Sara</i> did not
find it fatally easy to bring to heel. Anyhow, after marriage she
quickly grew bored to death of him; so much so that it required an
attempt (badly bungled) by another woman to get <i>Euan</i> to elope
with her, and a providential collapse of the very unwilling Lothario, to
bring about that happy ending that my experience of kind
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Norris</span> has taught me to expect. I may add
that he has never done anything more quietly entertaining than the
frustrated elopement; the luncheon scene at the M&eacute;tropole,
Brighton, between the angry but amused <i>Sara</i> and a husband
incapacitated by rage, remorse and chill, is an especially well-handled
little comedy of manners.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>Sir <span class='smcap'>Julian Corbett</span>, in writing the first
volume of <i>Naval Operations</i> (<span class='smcap'>Longmans</span>),
has carried the semi-official history of the War at sea only as far as
the Battle of the Falklands; but if the other three or four
volumes&mdash;the number is still uncertain&mdash;are to be as full of
romance as this the complete work will be a library of adventure in
itself. Hardly ever turning aside to praise or blame, he says with
almost unqualified baldness a multitude of astounding
things&mdash;things we half knew, or guessed, or longed to have
explained, or dared not whisper, or, most of all, never dreamt of. Here
is a gold-mine for the makers of boys' books of all future generations
to quarry in. Think, for instance, of the liner
<i>Ortega</i> shaking off a German cruiser by bolting into an uncharted
tide-race near the Horn; or the <i>Southport</i>, left for
disabled by her captors, crawling two thousand miles to
safety with only half an engine; or the triumphant raider
<i>Karlsruhe</i>, her pursuers baffled, full to the hatches with
captured luxuries, bands playing, flags flying, suddenly blown up in
mid-Atlantic. The game of hide-and-seek, as played by the <i>Emden</i>
and her like, naturally figures very largely in a volume
which <span class='smcap'>Henty</span> could hardly have bettered. The
author's veracious narrative, leaving all picturesque detail to the
imagination, gets home every time by the sheer weight of its material.
The War in Home waters is no less fascinatingly reconstructed, and the
case of maps contains in itself living epics for all who study them with
understanding.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>In writing her second book Miss <span class='smcap'>Hilda M.
Sharp</span> has allowed herself what is, I suspect, the lady novelist's
greatest treat, the extraordinary achievement of using the first person
singular and making it masculine. She has done it very well too, and I
am happy to recall that, in another place, I was among the many who
prophesied good concerning her future when she made
her <i>d&eacute;but</i> as a novelist with <i>The Stars in their
Courses</i> in Mr. <span class='smcap'>Fisher Unwin's</span> "First
Novel Library." <i>A Pawn in Pawn</i> comes very properly from the same
publisher. It has one of those plots which it is most particularly a
reviewer's business, in the reader's own interest, not to reveal, but it
is permissible to explain that the "pawn" of the title is a little girl
adopted from an orphanage, where, as someone says, "the orphans aren't
really orphans," by <i>Julian Tarrant</i>, whom a select circle
acknowledged as the greatest poet that the last years of the nineteenth
century produced. Miss
<span class='smcap'>Sharp</span> earns my special admiration by getting
through the inevitable description of the beginning of the Great War in
fewer words than anybody whose attempt I have yet encountered, and
steers throughout a pleasant course midway between a "bestseller" and a
"high-brow." <i>Lydia</i>, the "pawn," is very charming, but quite
possibly so, and though, of course, she must marry one of the three men
interested in her adoption Miss <span class='smcap'>Sharp</span> will
probably keep most of her readers, as she did me, in doubt as to which
it is to be until quite the end of the book. I think that he may prove
an acquired taste with most readers; but directly I found that he was
apt to quote the reviews in <i>Punch</i> I realised that he was a man of
discrimination and deserved his good luck.</p>

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
